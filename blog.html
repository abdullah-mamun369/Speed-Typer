        <h1>Difference between Local storage and Session storage</h1>
        <p class="first-p">
          <span class="p-heading">Local Storage: </span>This read-only interface
          property provides access to the Document’s local storage object, the
          stored data is stored across browser sessions. Similar to
          sessionStorage, except that localStorage data gets cleared when the
          page session ends – that is when the page is closed. It is cleared
          when the last “private” tab of a browser is closed (localStorage data
          for a document loaded in a private browsing or incognito session).
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="p-heading">Session Storage: </span>Session Storage
          objects can be accessed using the sessionStorage read-only property.
          The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that
          localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is
          cleared when the page session ends. <br />
          <br />

          A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a
          browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time. Pages
          are only saved for the amount of time that the tab or the browser is
          open; they do not persist after the page reloads and restores. A new
          session is created each time a tab or window is opened; this is
          different from session cookies. Each tab/window that is opened with
          the same URL creates its own sessionStorage.When you duplicate a tab,
          the sessionStorage from the original tab is copied to the duplicated
          tab. Closing a window/tab ends the session and clears sessionStorage
          objects.

      <!-- difference between Block Scope and Global Scope -->
      <div class="blogs-card">
        <h1>Difference between Global Scope and Block Scope</h1>
        <p class="first-p">
          <span class="p-heading">Global Scope: </span>When a variable is
          globally scoped, it means it is available from anywhere in your
          program. Declaring a variable outside a function or a block outside a
          function leads to it being globally scoped.
        </p>
        <p>
          <span class="p-heading">Block Scope: </span>A block scoped variable
          means that the variable defined within a block will not be accessible
          from outside the block. A block can reside inside a function, and a
          block scoped variable will not be available outside the block even if
          the block is inside a function. <br />
          <br />

          When variables are declared within a function or a block, they are
          locally scoped. It means that they can only be accessed inside the
          function or the block they were declared in.

        <p class="first-p">
          <span class="event-loop"
            >While it might require an in-depth understanding of languages like
            C++ and C to write full-scale production code, JavaScript can often
            be written with just a basic understanding of what can be done with
            the language.</span

          <br /><br />
          Concepts, like passing callbacks to functions or writing asynchronous
          code, are often not so difficult to implement, which makes most
          JavaScript developers care less about what goes on under the hood.
          They just don’t care about understanding the complexities that have
          deeply abstracted from them by the language.
          <br />
          <br />
          As a JavaScript developer, it becomes increasingly important to
          understand what really happens under the hood and how most of these
          complexities abstracted from us really work. It helps us make more
          informed decisions, which can, in turn, boost our code performance
          drastically. <br />
          <br />
          This article focuses on one of the very important but seldom
          understood concepts or terms in JavaScript. The EVENT LOOP!. <br />
          Writing asynchronous code can not be avoided in JavaScript, but why
          does a code running asynchronously really mean? i.e. The Event Loop
          <br />
          <br />
          Before we can understand how the event loop works, we first have to
          understand what JavaScript itself is and how it works!
